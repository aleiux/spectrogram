# spectrogram
A simple .wav reader and a DFT calculator.

These tools were developed so I could use them with my CS184 project, which resulted in this:
http://inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~CS184-ev/assignment1/index.html (link valid only until end of spring 2015 semester)

There are more files that deal with the spectrogram analysis, but I can't include them here because they are integrated with the project files and thus must be kept private for academic integrity.

I will add some better documentation once I'm not too busy with school projects.
